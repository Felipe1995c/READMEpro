## Installation
First you must create a gitignore file where you can place all the node modules that you dont want uploaded to your project. Then, you need to install the modules using npm install inquirer. After that you can use node index.js to call on the file and prompt you with the questions to begin your file. 

## Usage
My app can create a README file by answering the questions prompted.
